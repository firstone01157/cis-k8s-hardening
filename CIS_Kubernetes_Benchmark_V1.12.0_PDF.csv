A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created resources into logically named groups. Resources created in one namespace can be hidden from other namespaces. By default, each resource created by a user in Kubernetes cluster runs in a default namespace, called default. You can create additional namespaces and attach resources and users to them. You can use Kubernetes Authorization plugins to create policies that segregate access to namespace resources between different users.|You need to switch between namespaces for administration.|Run the below command and review the namespaces created in the cluster. kubectl get namespaces Ensure that these namespaces are the ones you need and are adequately administered as per your requirements.|Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need them.|By default, Kubernetes starts with 4 initial namespaces: 1. default - The default namespace for objects with no other namespace 2. kube-system - The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system 3. kube-node-lease - Namespace used for node heartbeats 4. kube-public - Namespace used for public information in a cluster  Internal Only - General|1. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with- objects/namespaces/#viewing-namespaces 2. http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/08/security-best-practices-kubernetes- deployment.html 3. https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/589- efficient-node-heartbeats|
To Review|5.6.2||Ensure that the seccomp profile is set to docker/default in your pod definitions (Manual)|• Level 2 - Master Node|Enable docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions.|Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container.|If the docker/default seccomp profile is too restrictive for you, you would have to create/manage your own seccomp profiles.|Review the pod definitions in your cluster. It should create a line as below: securityContext: seccompProfile: type: RuntimeDefault|Use security context to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An example is as below: securityContext: seccompProfile: type: RuntimeDefault|By default, seccomp profile is set to unconfined which means that no seccomp profiles are enabled.|1. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/seccomp/ 2. https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/  Internal Only - General|
To Review|5.6.3||Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers (Manual)|• Level 2 - Master Node|Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers|A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context.|If you incorrectly apply security contexts, you may have trouble running the pods.|Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that you have security contexts defined as appropriate.|Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker Containers.|By default, no security contexts are automatically applied to pods.|1. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/security-context/ 2. https://learn.cisecurity.org/benchmarks  Internal Only - General|
To Review|5.6.4||The default namespace should not be used (Manual)|• Level 2 - Master Node|Kubernetes provides a default namespace, where objects are placed if no namespace is specified for them. Placing objects in this namespace makes application of RBAC and other controls more difficult.|Resources in a Kubernetes cluster should be segregated by namespace, to allow for security controls to be applied at that level and to make it easier to manage resources.|None|"Run this command to list objects in default namespace kubectl get $(kubectl api-resources --verbs=list --namespaced=true -o name | paste -sd, -) --ignore-not-found -n default The only entries there should be system managed resources such as the kubernetes service"|Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.|Unless a namespace is specific on object creation, the default namespace will be used||
